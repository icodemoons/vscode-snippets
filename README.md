# VS Code and Emmet Snippets and Settings

## What is this?

These are my own snippets and settings for modern web development using VS Code.

I don't like installing extensions into VS Code unless they are absolutely required because I want things runninng _fast_. Why download thousands of shortcuts and snippets that are out of date and that I don't use when I can write custom snippets that fit my workflow perfectly, _and_ sharpen my coding skills while I am at it!

## How to use?

To use, just copy/point your settings (json view) to these files

- settings.json (VS Code)
- snippets.json (Emmet)

#nextjs #reactjs #tailwindcss #mongodb
